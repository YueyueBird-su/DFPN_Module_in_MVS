## :wave:Introduction

In this paper, we propose an adaptive region aggregation approach (DFPN) that employs a deformable kernel and offset regularization to address the issue of imprecise depth maps in occlusion and parallax break regions. The proposed DFPN method can adaptively aggregate neighboring features around a single pixel, and the offset regularization accelerates the offset convergence in MVS while enhancing attention to local region features. Notably, DFPN can be seamlessly integrated into existing coarse-to-fine MVS methods and yields considerable performance gains, as demonstrated by our experiments with CasMVSNet and TransMVSNet. Our results demonstrate that our method not only improves the accuracy of depth maps in large outdoor scenes but also achieves excellent 3D reconstruction quality. In addition, because the training and evaluation datasets are different, DFPN also demonstrate good generalization ability.

## :point_down:Training&Evaluation

In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, we trained it on two public datasets [DTU](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36) and [BlendedMVS](https://github.com/YoYo000/BlendedMVS), and compared it with the original method on [DTU](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36)，[BlendedMVS](https://github.com/YoYo000/BlendedMVS) and [Tanks and Temples](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/) benchmarks. We kept the same parameter settings as in the original method. For specific parameters, please refer to:

[CasMVSNet+Ours](CasMVSNet+Ours)

[TransMVSNet+Ours](TransMVSNet+Ours)

## :+1:Quality Testing

To evaluate the effectiveness of the model after the training, we need to test the accuracy of the results. The asterisk symbol (*) denotes our ports of the implementation, that may not re-produce the original results due to different post-processing and parameter tuning.

### DTU

- Download [SampleSet](http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36) and [Points](http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36), and unzip them and place `Points` folder in `SampleSet/MVS Data/`

  ```
  SampleSet
  ├──MVS Data
        └──Points
  ```

-  Set `dataPath` as path to `SampleSet/MVS Data/`, `plyPath` as directory that stores *the reconstructed point clouds*, `resultsPath` as directory to store *the evaluation results* in `BaseEvalMain_web.m`

- Final run `BaseEvalMain_web.m` in matlab

- The results in different method are:

| **Method**       | **Acc.(mm)** :arrow_down: | **Comp.(mm)**  :arrow_down: | **Overall(mm)**  :arrow_down: |
| :--------------- | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: |

| +Ours(258_limit) |         **0.371**         |          **0.277**          |           **0.324**           |

### BlendedMVS

- As BlendedMVS does not provide a point cloud as a measure of accuracy, the evaluation metric is based solely on the accuracy of the depth map, where `epe` denotes the average endpoint error and `e1` denotes the percentage of points with `epe` exceeding 1 mm.
- The results in different method are:

| **Method**       | epe(mm):arrow_down: | e1(%):arrow_down: | e3(%):arrow_down: |
| :--------------- | :-----------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| CasMVSNet (*)    |        2.34         |       25.49       |       9.44        |
| CasMVSNet+DFPN   |      **2.24**       |     **24.77**     |     **9.16**      |
| TransMVSNet (*)  |        1.16         |       15.23       |       6.35        |
